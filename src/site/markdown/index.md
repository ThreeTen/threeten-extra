## <i></i> About

**ThreeTen-Extra** provides additional date-time classes that complement those in
[Java SE 8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html).

Not every piece of date/time logic is destined for the JDK.
Some concepts are too specialized or too bulky to make it in.
This project provides some of those additional classes as a well-tested and reliable jar.
It is curated by the primary author of the Java 8 date and time library, [Stephen Colebourne](http://www.joda.org/).

ThreeTen-Extra is licensed under the business-friendly [BSD 3-clause license](license.html).
