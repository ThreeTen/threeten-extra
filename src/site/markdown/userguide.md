## User guide

ThreeTen-Extra is a small library that builds on the Java SE 8
[`java.time`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) package.


## Value types

The additional value types operate exactly as per similar classes in Java SE 8.
These include:

* [`DayOfMonth`](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/DayOfMonth.html) - a day-of-month without month or year
* [`DayOfYear`](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/DayOfYear.html) - a day-of-year without year
* [`AmPm`](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/AmPm.html) - before or after midday
* [`Quarter`](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Quarter.html) - the four quarters, Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4
* [`YearQuarter`](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/YearQuarter.html) - combines a year and quarter, 2014-Q4
* [`YearWeek`](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/YearWeek.html) - combines a week-based-year and a week, 2014-W06
* [`Days`](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Days.html) - an amount of time measured in days
* [`Weeks`](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Weeks.html) - an amount of time measured in weeks
* [`Months`](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Months.html) - an amount of time measured in months
* [`Years`](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Years.html) - an amount of time measured in years
* [`Interval`](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/Interval.html) - an interval between two instants
* [`PeriodDuration`](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/PeriodDuration.html) - combines a `Period` and a `Duration`


## Calendar systems

The additional calendar systems operate exactly as per similar classes in Java SE 8.
These include:

* [Accounting](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/chrono/AccountingChronology.html) calendar system
* [British Cutover](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/chrono/BritishCutoverChronology.html) calendar system
* [Coptic](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/chrono/CopticChronology.html) calendar system
* [Discordian](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/chrono/DiscordianChronology.html) calendar system
* [Ethiopic](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/chrono/EthiopicChronology.html) calendar system
* [International Fixed](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/chrono/InternationalFixedChronology.html) calendar system
* [Julian](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/chrono/JulianChronology.html) calendar system
* [Pax](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/chrono/PaxChronology.html) calendar system
* [Symmetry010](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/chrono/Symmetry010Chronology.html) calendar system
* [Symmetry454](apidocs/org/threeten/extra/chrono/Symmetry454Chronology.html) calendar system


## Time scales

The JDK operates exclusively using the Java time-scale, defined in
[Instant](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html).
That time-scale eliminates leap seconds using UTC-SLS, although the JDK implementation
is typically based on a POSIX-like clock (and thus relatively undefined around leap seconds).

ThreeTen-Extra provides the additional classes that were rejected from JDK 8.
They were not included as they were deemed to be too specialized for the JDK.

Use `TaiInstant` if you need an instant using the TAI time-scale.

Use `UtcInstant` if you need an instant using the UTC time-scale.
The leap second data is provided in a text file loaded via the `ServiceLoader`.
Only whole leap seconds are handled, and data starts from 1972 by default.
