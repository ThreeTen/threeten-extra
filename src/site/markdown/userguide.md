## User guide

ThreeTen-Extra is a small library that builds on the Java SE 8
[`java.time`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/package-summary.html) package.


## Value types

The additional value types operate exactly as per similar classes in Java SE 8.
These include:

* [`DayOfMonth`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/DayOfMonth.html) - a day-of-month without month or year
* [`DayOfYear`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/DayOfYear.html) - a day-of-year without year
* [`AmPm`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/AmPm.html) - before or after midday
* [`Quarter`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/Quarter.html) - the four quarters, Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4
* [`YearQuarter`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/YearQuarter.html) - combines a year and quarter, 2014-Q4
* [`YearWeek`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/YearWeek.html) - combines a week-based-year and a week, 2014-W06
* [`Days`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/Days.html) - an amount of time measured in days
* [`Weeks`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/Weeks.html) - an amount of time measured in weeks
* [`Months`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/Months.html) - an amount of time measured in months
* [`Years`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/Years.html) - an amount of time measured in years
* [`Interval`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/Interval.html) - an interval between two instants
* [`PeriodDuration`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/PeriodDuration.html) - combines a `Period` and a `Duration`


## Period/Duration formatting

The JDK does not provide a mechanism to format periods or durations beyond ISO-8601.
A simple mechanism is provided here in [`AmountFormats`](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/AmountFormats.html):

```
 Period period = Period.of(1, 6, 5);
 String str = AmountFormats.wordBased(period, Locale.ENGLISH);
 // output: "1 year, 6 months and 5 days"
```

Translations are provided for ca, cs, da, de, en, es, fr, it, ja, nl, pl, pt, ro, ru, sv, tr.

## Calendar systems

The additional calendar systems operate exactly as per similar classes in Java SE 8.
These include:

* [Accounting](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/chrono/AccountingChronology.html) calendar system
* [British Cutover](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/chrono/BritishCutoverChronology.html) calendar system
* [Coptic](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/chrono/CopticChronology.html) calendar system
* [Discordian](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/chrono/DiscordianChronology.html) calendar system
* [Ethiopic](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/chrono/EthiopicChronology.html) calendar system
* [International Fixed](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/chrono/InternationalFixedChronology.html) calendar system
* [Julian](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/chrono/JulianChronology.html) calendar system
* [Pax](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/chrono/PaxChronology.html) calendar system
* [Symmetry010](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/chrono/Symmetry010Chronology.html) calendar system
* [Symmetry454](apidocs/org.threeten.extra/org/threeten/extra/chrono/Symmetry454Chronology.html) calendar system


## Time scales

The JDK operates exclusively using the Java time-scale, defined in
[Instant](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html).
That time-scale eliminates leap seconds using UTC-SLS, although the JDK implementation
is typically based on a POSIX-like clock (and thus relatively undefined around leap seconds).

ThreeTen-Extra provides the additional classes that were rejected from JDK 8.
They were not included as they were deemed to be too specialized for the JDK.

Use `TaiInstant` if you need an instant using the TAI time-scale.

Use `UtcInstant` if you need an instant using the UTC time-scale.

The leap second data is provided in a text file loaded from the classpath.
Only whole leap seconds are handled, and data starts from 1972 by default.
To replace the built in leap seconds file, create a file `META-INF/org/threeten/extra/scale/LeapSeconds.txt`.
The content should have two columns as per [this format](https://github.com/ThreeTen/threeten-extra/blob/0cf61e35fc165062eb70a66b026c54c261dce46d/src/main/resources/org/threeten/extra/scale/LeapSeconds.txt).
