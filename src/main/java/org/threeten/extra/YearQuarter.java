/**
 * A year-quarter in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as {@code 2007-Q2}.
 * <p>
 * {@code YearQuarter} is an immutable date-time object that represents the combination
 * of a year and quarter. Any field that can be derived from a year and quarter can be obtained.
 * A quarter is defined by {@link Quarter} and {@link Month#firstMonthOfQuarter()} - Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.
 * Q1 is January to March, Q2 is April to June, Q3 is July to September and Q4 is October to December.
 * <p>
 * This class does not store or represent a day, time or time-zone.
 * For example, the value "2nd quarter 2007" can be stored in a {@code YearQuarter}.
 * <p>
 * The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 * in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
 * system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 * For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
 * However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
 * to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
 * Note that the ISO-8601 standard does not define or refer to quarters.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Requirements:</h3>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * This class must be treated as a value type. Do not synchronize, rely on the
 * identity hash code or use the distinction between equals() and ==.
