 * in the year-of-era count, are part of the 'Before Current Era' era.

 * The start of accounting epochs {@code 0001-01-01 (Accounting)} will vary against the ISO calendar.
 * Depending on options chosen, it can start as early as {@code 0000-12-26 (ISO)} or as late as {@code 0001-12-04 (ISO)}.
 * <p>
 * <b>Do not use {@code ordinal()} to obtain the numeric representation of {@code AccountingEra}.
 * Use {@code getValue()} instead.</b>
