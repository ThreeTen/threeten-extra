/**
 * A year-week in the ISO week date system such as {@code 2015-W13}
 * <p>
 * {@code YearWeek} is an immutable date-time object that represents the combination
 * of a week-based-year and week-of-week-based-year.
 * Any field that can be derived from those two fields can be obtained.
 * <p>
 * This class does not store or represent a day, time or time-zone.
 * For example, the value "13th week of 2007" can be stored in a {@code YearWeek}.
 * <p>
 * The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 * in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
 * system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 * For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
 * However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
 * to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.
 * <p>
 * ISO-8601 defines the week as always starting with Monday.
 * The first week is the week which contains the first Thursday of the calendar year.
 * As such, the week-based-year used in this class does not align with the calendar year.
 *
 * <h3>Implementation Requirements:</h3>
 * This class is immutable and thread-safe.
 * <p>
 * This class must be treated as a value type. Do not synchronize, rely on the
 * identity hash code or use the distinction between equals() and ==.
